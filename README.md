# reactjs-toplevels

Inspired by David Gilbertson's blog [Modals in React](https://codeburst.io/modals-in-react-f6c3ff9f4701),
this sample application implements a mechanism to display top-level components such as context menus,
modal dialogue boxes and (non-modal) informational or error message popups.

The current version show-cases context-menus as one of the possible top-level component types.
