# reactjs-toplevels

Inspired by David Gilbertson's blog [Modals in React](https://codeburst.io/modals-in-react-f6c3ff9f4701), this sample application implements a mechanism to display toplevel components such as context menus, modal dialogue boxes and (non-modal) informational or error message popups.
